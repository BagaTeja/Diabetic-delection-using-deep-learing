In this project, we will train a deep neural network model to recognise the kind of Diabetic Retinopathy from photos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks. 
Diabetic Retinopathy is the primary cause of blindness in the developed world's working-age population, affecting approximately 347 million people globally.
Diabetic Retinopathy is a consequence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes that can occur if blood sugar levels are not maintained for an extended length of time.
Doctors will be able to diagnose blindness before it occurs because to Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning.
